Description:

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) data and associated metadata.  Data includes
XAS and XRF data serialized as text using the XAS Data Interchange specification
(https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange). These data were
measured at NIST's Beamline for Materials Measurement
(https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/beamlines/beamline.php?r=6-bm) at the National
Synchrotron Light Source II (https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2).

The aim of this collection is to provide a chemically and structurally diverse
set of example XAS spectra measured on elements across the periodic table and
accessible at BMM. As such, these data are collected using a single photon
delivery system and a consistent set of detectors and detector readout systems.

The physical samples from which these data were collected are maintained in a
library at BMM and made available for use by visitors to the beamline.

Data Overview
-------------

The "Data/" folder contains subfolders for each element represented in the collection.
Inside those folders are column ASCII data files using the XDI formatting specification
for serializing metadata.  The filnames all follow the format of "Element-Edge-Material.xdi"

The "tmpl/" folder contains HTML templates for formatting the web presentation of these data.

The "tiled/" folder contains configuration and example code for converting to a Tiled
representation of this data collection.  Tiled is the data management service used at NBSLS-II:
https://blueskyproject.io/tiled/

The remaining files are used to generate the web page representation of the collection.

Many of the physical samples in this collection were provided by Dr. Martin Stennett of
the University of Sheffield.  Many other users of BMM have made contributions to this library
over the years of BMM's operation.
